#Bootcamp Exercise 1

#1 Write a for loop statements so that it runs from 1:9 and prints the following output to your screen
for(x in 1:9){
  if (x < 9){
    cat("\n")}
  else{
    cat("\n*")}
}

#2 Modify your for loop so that it prints 10 asterisks, with each asterisk separated by exactly one ampersand sign (&), with no spaces or new line characters.
for(x in 1:9){
  if (x < 9){
    cat("*&")}
  else{
    cat("*&*")}
}

#3 by hand, figure out the initial values of these variables and values at the the start and end of each iteration of the loop
dogs <- 10;# dogs starts as 10
for (i in 1:5){ #perform 5 itterations
  dogs <- dogs + 1; # add 1 to the previous value of dogs
} #once iterations are complete dogs = 15
###
meatloaf <- 0; #meatloaf starts at 0
for (i in 5:9){ #perform 4 itterations between 5 and 9
  meatloaf <- meatloaf - i + 1; #previous value of meatloaf -i +1
  cat(meatloaf) #show the value of meatloaf at the end of that itteration
}# the end value of meatlaof is 0-4-5-6-7-8= -30
###
bubbles <- 12; #starting value is 12
for (i in -1:-4){#perform 4 itterations, between -1 and -4
  bubbles <- i; # bubbles becomes the value of i
}# bubbles = -4

#4 modify this code so that it will print out a message during presidential as well as congressional election years
###you can use the if statement with the modulus operator to conditionally perform operations
years <- c( 2015, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021)
for(ii in 1:length(years)){
  if(years[ii] %% 2 == 0 && !(years[ii] %% 4 == 0) ){
    cat(years[ii], 'Hooray, congressional elections!', sep = '\t', fill = T)
  }
  if((years[ii] %% 4 == 0) && (years[ii] %% 2 == 0)){
    cat(years[ii], 'Hooray, congressional AND presidential elections!', sep = '\t', fill = T)
  }
  
}

#5 More fun with loops. Here are the bank accounts from seven randomly selected UCLA grad students
bankAccounts <- c(10, 9.2, 5.6, 3.7, 8.8, 0.5);
#Now look at the error message the following lines of code produce. Can you think of a way to modify this loop so that the loop will compund the interest?
interestRate <- 0.0125;
compounded<-rep(bankAccounts)
for (i in 1:length(bankAccounts)) {
  compounded[i] <- interestRate*bankAccounts[i] + bankAccounts[i]; }
#HINT: variables must be initialized before you can perform operations on them
#HINT 2: look at the rep() function and see if you can use that to initialize a variable that will help you.

#6 Suppose we now want to compound the interest annually, but across a period of 5 years. The for loop we discussed earlier only compounds for a single year. 
bankAccounts <- c(10, 9.2, 5.6); #define bank accounts here
interestRate <- 0.0525;   
house <- c(4.8, 3.8, 5.7); #deduct
food<- c(3.5, 4.3, 5.0);    #deduct
fun <- c(7.8, 2.1, 10.5);  #deduct
#and incomes (through TAships) of 
income <- c(21, 21, 21); #add this
for (j in 1:5) {
  for (i in 1:length(bankAccounts)) {
    bankAccounts[i] <-bankAccounts[i]+income[i]-(house[i]+food[i]+fun[i]) #step 1 modify bankAccounts so that amounts reflect income and expenses
    bankAccounts[i] <-interestRate*bankAccounts[i] + bankAccounts[i]; #step 2 get calculate interest and add to accounts from step 1
    #you can actually use the line you have already written if you
    #modify amounts in bankAccounts directly in step 1
  }}

#7 Modify the 5-year interest-compounding code from #5 and #6 so that it runs from 2015-2020 and so that in odd numbered years students 1 and 3 get trust fund disbursements of $5000.
bankAccounts <- c(10, 9.2, 5.6);
house <- c(4.8, 3.8, 5.7); 
food<- c(3.5, 4.3, 5.0); 
fun <- c(7.8, 2.1, 10.5); 
income <- c(21, 21, 21);#and incomes (through TAships) of
years<-c( 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)
for(ii in 1:length(years)){
  if(years[ii] %% 2 == 0){
    for (i in 1:length(bankAccounts)) {
      bankAccounts[i] <-bankAccounts[i]+income[i]-(house[i]+food[i]+fun[i]) #step 1 modify bankAccounts so that amounts reflect income and expenses
      bankAccounts[i] <-interestRate*bankAccounts[i] + bankAccounts[i];}}
  else{
      if (i==2) {
        bankAccounts[i] <-bankAccounts[i]+income[i]-(house[i]+food[i]+fun[i])
        bankAccounts[i] <-interestRate*bankAccounts[i] + bankAccounts[i];}
      else {
        bankAccounts[i] <-5+bankAccounts[i]+income[i]-(house[i]+food[i]+fun[i]) #step 1 modify bankAccounts so that amounts reflect income and expenses
        bankAccounts[i] <-interestRate*bankAccounts[i] + bankAccounts[i];}
}}

#8 use a while loop to sum all numbers from 1:17. You will need to use a counter variable (like index seen in class).
x<-0
while(i <=17){
  x<-x+i
  i<- i+1}

#9 write a function takes a number, and prints ‘small’ if number less than or equal to -1; ‘medium’ if between -1 and + 1’big’ if greater than or equal to + 1
BIGsmall<-function(n){
  for(i in 1:length(n)){
    if(n[i] <= -1){
     cat("small ")}
    else if(n[i] >= 1){
      cat("big ")}
    else{
      cat("medium ")}
}}
n<- c(-1,0,1)
BIGsmall(n)
